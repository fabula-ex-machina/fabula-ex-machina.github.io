# Fabula ex Machina
<pre>
  <b>Deus ex machina</b> is a Latin calque from Greek ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός (apò mēkhanês theós) 'god from the machine'.
  The term was coined from the conventions of ancient Greek theater, where actors who were playing gods were 
  brought on stage using a machine. The machine could be either a crane (mechane) used to lower actors from 
  above or a riser that brought them up through a trapdoor. 

  <b>Fabula ex machina</b> means literally 'fairy tale from the machine'. It stands for the phenomenon of imaginary
  facts construction by a Language Model. It replaces the incorrect analogy to biological 'hallucination' invented 
  by Andrej Karpathy which is incorrect and can not be further from reality.
